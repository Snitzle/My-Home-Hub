### To Do

I've been made aware that Job is not a good name to use in a model because of the queue jobs, so I will refactor this on all models that use the phrase Job.

- Fill out Mortgage Migrations
- Fill out Tenancy Agreements Migrations
- Add purchase document uploads for House
- Add Purchase comments
- Add Snags list to jobs page
- Attach images to jobs
- Add Safety certificates to properties
- Add a Content Editor to all textareas instead
- Refactor views to be the correct hierarchy
- Add Breadcrumbs
- Add Start and end date to Property Jobs
- Add Property Job start and end date to seeder
- Define partial resources so only the routes I need are in use
- Add reminder functionality to Property Jobs
- Refactor jobs as Tasks
- Refactor Inputs to use built in Breeze components ( Is this actually better? )
- Hash everything so I can't see private details in the database
- Add Logic to process prices. Decide on a definite set of rules for input


### To Create

- Insurance Policies
- Create Boiler migration
- Set up Boiler relationships on models

- implement Roles and permissions once basic models and logic are inplemented
- Consider security, how am I going to store this data securely


### Testing 

- Changing options saves 
- Changing options effects said option e.g. notification frequency
